# RJ45 Eurorack Bridge

A system that allows impromptu collaboration between Eurorack modular synthesists, while maintaining an appropriate distance during the COVID-19 pandemic.


## Build

1. Make the circuitboard using the files provided (or buy it from https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/3NctJJYb)
2. Solder the required components
  * 1 x Wurth Elecktronik Shielded Ethernet Connector p/n 615008140421 from [Mouser](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Wurth-Elektronik/615008140421?qs=%2Fha2pyFadujj32eJSvwd90ECqRKXOEYbwVGH%2FNq2N1eMDIxBQFOhvg%3D%3D)
  * 8 x PJ301M-12 3.5mm switching mono jacks (aka Thonkiconn) from [Thonk](https://www.thonk.co.uk/shop/3-5mm-jacks/), [AI Synthesis](https://aisynthesis.com/product/3-5mm-eurorack-jack-thonk-pj301m-12/), [Control](https://www.ctrl-mod.com/products/3-5mm-eurorack-jacks), [synthCube](https://synthcube.com/cart/3-5mm-euro-jacks), etc
3. Make an enclosure using the template provided or purchase a Hammond Manufacturing 1590A diecast aluminum enclosure p/n 1590A from [Mouser](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Hammond-Manufacturing/1590A?qs=lxPAlgZqN%2Fx6Rw4O%2FIXFww%3D%3D)
4. Get a hold of a *shielded* ethernet cable  

## Ideas

* Have your collaborator do the above (remember that Oshpark gives you three PCBs), then meet up and create sound together, while maintaining a safe distance.
* Consider working/performing outdoors, over a fence, from neighboring houses, or in separate cars.
* Indoors, try collaborating blindly while in separate rooms without telling each other what kind of signal is on each of the jacks. Change them mid-performance.
* **Don't connect the other end of the ethernet cable to anything other than another one of these devices***
